This extracts terms and entities from a JSON. It currently supports extracting set lists of terms and words in ALLCAPS. In the future it will support extracting names, locations, and dates/times. To use, download the gem 'entityextractor'.

Extract set list of terms-
e = EntityExtractor.new(JSON, "field name to extract from")
e.extractTerms(terms, to, extract)

Extract ALLCAPS-
e = EntityExtractor.new(JSON, "field name to extract from")
e.extractALLCAPS(minimum # of all caps characters in a row to look for, [array of terms to ignore])

Get output-
JSON with terms appended to each item: e.genJSON
Hash of all terms extracted: e.getExtract
